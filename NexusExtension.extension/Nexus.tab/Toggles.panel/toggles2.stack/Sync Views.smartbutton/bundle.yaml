tooltip: >-
  Keep views synchronized. This means that as you pan and zoom and

  switch between Plan and RCP views, this tool will keep the views

  in the same zoomed area so you can keep working in the same

  area without the need to zoom and pan again.

  This tool works best when the views are maximized
