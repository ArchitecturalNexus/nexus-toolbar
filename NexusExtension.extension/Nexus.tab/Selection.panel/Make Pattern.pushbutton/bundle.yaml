  Draw your pattern tile in a detail view using detail lines, curves, circles or ellipses, or even filled regions

  Select the pattern lines and curves and run this tool. Give the pattern a name and hit "Create Pattern". The tool asks you to pick the boundary corners of the pattern. The tool will process the input lines, approximates the curves and splines with smaller lines and finds the best angles for these lines and will generate a pattern. It also reads the patterns from selected filled regions and will combine with selected detail lines


  TIP: You can export existing patterns if no lines are selected


  TRICK: You can convert existing pattern types by selecting a filled region only and create the opposite pattern type (selected drafting filled region and create model pattern)
